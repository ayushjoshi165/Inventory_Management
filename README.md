Inventory Management application - Java three tired architecture application

A 3-tier architecture is a software design pattern that consists of three main components: the presentation layer, the application layer, and the data layer.

In a 3-tier Java application, the presentation layer handles the user interface and user interactions. It is responsible for displaying information to the user and collecting input from the user. The application layer is responsible for handling the business logic and processing the data. It is responsible for performing the tasks that the user requests, such as data validation, data manipulation, and data access. The data layer is responsible for interacting with the database and storing or retrieving data.

This architecture separates the different concerns of the application, allowing for easy maintenance, scalability and flexibility. The presentation layer is independent of the application and data layers, and the application layer is independent of the data layer. This allows for changes to be made to one layer without affecting the other layers.

The 3-tier architecture also allows for better security, as the data layer can be protected by a firewall and the application layer can handle authentication and authorization.

In summary, a 3-tier architecture Java application is a software design pattern that separates the different concerns of the application into three main components: the presentation layer, the application layer, and the data layer. This approach allows for better maintainability, scalability, flexibility, and security of the application.
